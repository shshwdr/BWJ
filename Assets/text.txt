		Hello?

		Good, you've survived. 

		You're the first robot to make it to the Cube.

		The interference was very strong, we've no idea what functions were damaged.

		Try to START moving.

		If your movement algorithm gets stuck in a loop, try turning around.

		The surface of the Cube is always changing.

		Our best analysis can't understand the pattern... if there is one.

		You're one of our most advanced learning AI, so you should be able to adapt, if...

		Well, try moving through this new design.

		One of the outposts detected a signal around a yellow star. The technology is very, very old. I'd not seen anything like it before.

		That star? You're joking. That system is long dead.

		No. There's a whole civilization out there. Hidden from us for millennia.

		Or they hid themselves.

		Their technology is not advanced enough. Somebody did this to them.

		Incredible, we must learn more about them. Maybe make first contact

		It is the year 207X. Strange cubes have been discovered in the outer solar system. They are smooth and reflective, and bigger than anything humans have sent into space.

Probes and rovers were sent but destroyed before they got to the surface by the interference around the cubes. An expedition crew was sent and disappeared too.

Everybody on earth is following the mystery. What is it? How is it here?

*Who* put it here?
